![Ping Test](Picture1.png)

- Example from My Experience:
While setting up a URL Ping Test in Azure Application Insights, I faced repeated DNS resolution failure errors, even though the site was accessible via browser.

üîç Issue:
I had used monitorwebapp.net instead of the correct www.monitorwebapp.net, and DNS records were not properly configured.

üîß Fix:
Updated the URL to https://www.monitorwebapp.net, verified DNS using nslookup, and ensured it pointed to the Azure App Service. The test passed after correction.

## üìò Log Monitoring for VM ware in Azure and Windows Server
-  Objective:
To collect, analyze, and visualize logs from both VMware-based virtual machines and Windows Servers in Azure using Log Analytics.

‚úÖ Setup Steps:
Install Azure Monitor Agent or Log Analytics Agent on the Windows Server.

Connect the data source(VM) to a Log Analytics Workspace.

Enable data collection rules for:
Event logs (e.g., Application, System, Security)

Adding Performance counters (e.g., CPU, RAM, Disk)

Query KQL to collect the server data
